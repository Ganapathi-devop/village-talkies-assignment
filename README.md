# Employee Hirarchiy

A brief description of what this project does 
## Frontend Assignment from village talkies

Build a page that allows the user to visualise and update an employee organization chart 
interactively with drag & drop. 
### Data Model: 
- Employee: 
- ID
- Name
- Designation
- Team
- Manager - (points to another employeeâ€™s ID)

### Expected User Interface: 
On the left, show a list of employees pulled from an API endpoint. For each employee, show the 
name, designation, team on the list item. This list should have a search box to type and jump to 
an employee by any of the properties as well as a dropdown filter to filter the list of employees 
by a specific team.
When I use the left sidebar filter to filter the list by a specific team, only show the chart for those 
employees. 

On the right side of the screen, based on the entire list of employees, generate a tree like chart
